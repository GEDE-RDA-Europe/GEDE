At the RDA Plenary at 22.10 RDA GEDE held a side workshop on (FAIR) Digital Objects with two goals:

    - inform evryone about the recent developments from Digital Objects to FAIR Digital Objects and converge on a set 
      of guidelines 
    
    - present & discuss the recent developments in specification and implementation activities

Agenda of the meeting:

13.00   Larry Lannnom       Lunch, Introductions, Agenda Bashing

13.30   Peter Wittenburg    Challenges for large infrastructures, such as EOSC, and th FAIR DO Approach

14.00   Kostas Glinos       EOSC Developments and Expectations

14.30   Larry Lannom        FAIR DO Components: What do we have and what is missing

15.00   Community Speakers
                            
16.00   Luiz Bonino         Draft FAIR DO Framework,Rough Convergencee, Future Plans

17.00   Larry Lannom        Concusions

For this meeting we will not write a report, since we planned a convergence meeting on FAIR DOs at 28/29.10 in Paris. 
However, from this meeting and the RDA Plenary it became clear that

    - the FAIR DO are seen as an integrative technology that could facilitate realising complex infrastructures such as 
      EOSC etc.
    
    - the RDA discussions over the last years were so crucial for achieving the convergence on FAIR DO which we have now
    
    - many basic components such as the DO Interface protocol, the Handle System, the Data Type Registry, and reference 
      software for repositories are available, but that much needs to be done in particular to integrate legacy setups
      
    - some communities already apply FDO technology but that more funding will be necessary to achieve a breakthrough
