The Digital Objects have been defined in early papers by R. Kahn and the work in various RDA groups, in particular in the RDA 
Data Foundation & Terminology WG. Intensiv discussions during the last few months including colleagues from GOFAIR resulted in the 
knowledge that the DO Model needs to be extended by explicit semantics to meet the emerging criteria of the FAIR Maturity Indicator work and to make them machine actionable.

We just finished an international workshop in Paris where the participants agreed to write an FDO Document that can be signed to form a 
broad community, to build a coordination group to organise the community and a technical expert group to advance the FDO specifications. 
This folder is meant to host from now on all documents related to the FAIR Digital Objects (FDO) and the FDO Framework specifying the 
requirements. Also in the case of FDOs we will maintain the openness which characterises the GEDE collaboration. 

Everyone interested can join the FDO interactions by sending a request to Zsuzsanna Szeredi (zsuzsanna.szeredi@gmail.com). With our 
limited resources we will try to maintain this GitHub page timely. The coordination group may decide at a certain moment to set up an 
own web-site.

The current members of the coordination group are: 
Francoise Genova, Edit Herczog, Larry Lannom, George Strawn, Robert Quick, Barend Mons, Dimitris Koureas, Koenraad de Smedt, Carlo Zwölf, Peter Wittenburg.

PS: Papers, Documents, etc. on DO and FDO can also be found here: https://github.com/GEDE-RDA-Europe/GEDE/tree/master/Digital-Objects
