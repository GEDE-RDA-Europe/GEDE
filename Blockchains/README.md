# Blockchain Technology
This folder contains all information that has been collected within the realm of the GEDE topic group as relevant for the discussion of blockchain technology (BCT) with a particular focus on possible application scenarios in the research domain. 

The folder also contains the final paper summarising th usefulness of BCT from a research perspective which may be controversial since blockchain technology is still in development. The final document is called: Blockchain Technology and FAIR Digital Objects - what is needed in science?
Please, send us your comments and other useful documents on "BCT in the resarch area".

Currently, we collected the following information which we believe is neutral and factual and not written by someone who wants to sell this technology.
- the Case Statement of the RDA WG on BCT in Health
- a paper from P. Lyons & R. Kahn about the framework in which BC and other technologies evolved over time
- two slide sets from V. Valivaari who is analysing the BCT for applying it in Finnish society
- a report written by NIST which we can recommend reading to understand BCT
- a summary of statements on BCT found in some documents incl. ERCIM contributions collected by W. Kuchinke & P. Wittenburg
- a link to an ERCIM special report on BCT which we can also recommend: https://ercim-news.ercim.eu/en110/special/introduction-to-the-special-theme-blockchain-engineering
- a first elaboration on BCT in the medical area from Kuchinke & Wittenburg
- a slide set from P. Nikander who analysed the requirements to run a full node
