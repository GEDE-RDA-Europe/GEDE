# GEDE
In 2020 GEDE started a new action line with the label "Canonical Worlflow Frameworks for Research (CWFR)" started by a group of about 40 experts from different research domains. It was decided to do all documentation and interaction using the OSF framework. For more detailed information look here: https://osf.io/2cy86/

- work on PIDs
