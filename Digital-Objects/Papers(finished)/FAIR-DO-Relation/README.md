This folder contains papers that relate the FAIR principles and the Digital Object concept which finally led to the term FAIR-DO, since FAIR-DOs are a way to implement the FAIR principles systematically.
Currently we have two documents listed here:
- a paper written by G. Strawn: "Open Science, Business Analytics, and FAIR Digital Objects"
- a paper written by E. Schultes (GOFAIR) & P. Wittenburg: "FAIR Principles and Digital Objects: Accelerating Convergence on a Data Infrastructure"
- we should also refer to the report of the EC's expert group on Implementing FAIR that also used the term FAIR-DO: https://publications.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/7769a148-f1f6-11e8-9982-01aa75ed71a1/language-en/format-PDF/source-80611283
- We expect another more elaborate paper from Schultes & Wittenburg soon.
