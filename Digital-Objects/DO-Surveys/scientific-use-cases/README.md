In 2018 we started a survey about scientific use cases of Digital Objects. In the first round we received more than 30 such use cases from various disciplines. We will also add those which we received in the realm of C2CAMP which is a global collaboration of peeople interested in applying Diital Objects. This folder will also contain the preliminary analysis and the template. If there are more communities in submitting their scientific cases we will integrate them in our further analysis and paper writing work.
