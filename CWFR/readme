The CWFR (Canonical Workflow Frameworks for Research) initiative is motivated by deep gaps which we found between technological 
possibilities and principles on the one hand and data practices on the other hand. Deep insights in about 70 research projects 
let us observe 2 major paradoxes:

(1) Researchers are aware about the FAIR principles, but do not yet want to change practices in the data labs. For making data 
FAIR they like to refer to the end phase of a data-driven project when a publication is being submitted. This will only include 
a bvery small fraction of data which is being produced and used and making data FAIR at the very end will be costly and not work.

(2) Analysing much effort in data creation, managing, and processing across disciplines one can observe recurring patterns of work 
steps, but individual researchers believe that there work is special. Despite much effort to create technical workflow frameworks 
during the last decades, these are hardly not used in the data labs. 

G. Strawn describes this as "Standards are good for science, but not for the individual scientists". The reason is of course that 
the individual researcher is under some stress to publish new results and does not like interruptions caused by new technological 
inventions. They like tools which help them mastering their work in the shortest time possible.

These paradoxes motivated us to start the CWFR initiative since it could address both paradoxes. Scientifically motivated workflows
empowered by FAIR Digital Objects could help the researcher in his/her daily work, make many steps more efficient by using automated 
workflow methods and would immediately create FAIR compliant data without bothering the researcher with details.
